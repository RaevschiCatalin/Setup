# Shell script

## Description
Made a small script to make my life easier, it creates and configures a new Vite(React+TS) and TailwindCSS + PostCSS + Autoprefixer so I dont do it manually every time
## Configuration
To configure the script as you wish you can open the setup.sh file in any code editor and modify all the paths as you wish( I've added comments on what you can modify)
## Usage
1) Download Zip file or clone the repository
2) Create a github repo with the name of your project
3) Open the terminal
4) Type: chmod +x setup.sh
5) ./setup.sh
6) Type your github repo name
7) Select the framework you wanna use
8) Press "O"
9) Enjoy
